# splitwise
I have created a simple web page that calculates the split value of expense provided the total expense and no.of persons
The display share will display a split window. pay link will lead to another html page. There I have an idea to add the payment modes for indiviual persons.
The backend is going to be dwimperl 
I couldn't finish the pay html page and
I tried adding perl file connectivity to store the split values. But somehow couldn't connect it.
